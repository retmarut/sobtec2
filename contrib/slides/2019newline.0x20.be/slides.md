*“Consumption cooperatives organise themselves in order to establish direct contact with providers, but then, why don’t people self-organise their technological providers, buying the technological support they need directly from them, like carrots?”* — Margarita Padilla

## 

*“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to **healthy and culturally appropriate** food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define own food and agriculture systems.  It puts those who **produce**, **distribute**, and **consume** food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of the market and corporations.”* <br> — Via Campesina
